#PURPOSE    -   Given a number, this program computes the
#               factorial. For example, the factorial of
#               3 is 3 * 2 * 1, or 6. The factorial of
#               4 is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, or 24, and so on.

#This program shows how to call a function. You
#call a function by first pushing all the arguments,
#then you call the function, and the resulting
#value is in %eax. The program can also change the
#passed parameters if it wants to.
